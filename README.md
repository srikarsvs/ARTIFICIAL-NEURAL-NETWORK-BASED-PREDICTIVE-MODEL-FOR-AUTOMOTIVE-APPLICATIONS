## Paper Abstract

The research introduces an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** based predictive model, specifically for **automotive applications**. Focusing on **passive fluid shock absorbers**, the study explores how ANN can predict parameters like **peak displacement, acceleration, power, and stiffness** for varied frequencies and fluid orifice conditions. Among several training techniques explored, the **Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG)** method demonstrated the lowest error, establishing it as the most accurate approach for predictive modeling in this domain.

### Key Findings:

- **ANN Prediction Accuracy**: The SCG technique achieved a minimal error rate compared to other training techniques such as **Resilient Back-propagation (RP)** and **BFGS Quasi-Newton (BFG)**, making it 57.53% more accurate than RP and 84.56% more accurate than BFG.

- **Automotive Application**: This model can enhance vehicle suspension design, improving both **driver comfort** and **vehicle handling**.

- **Practical Implementation**: MATLAB was used to develop and test the predictive model, with 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. Experimental results validated the model's effectiveness.

### Conclusion:

The developed ANN-based predictive model offers a computationally efficient way to predict essential parameters in **vehicle suspension systems**. The SCG method's superior performance in minimizing error makes it a valuable tool for automotive engineers. Future research will focus on further optimization of ANN parameters for improved results.
